* Building a Vagrant Base Box

** Objective

   [[http://vagrantup.com][Vagrant]] provides examples of getting started using a base box named
   precise32. That box is available at this URL:
   http://files.vagrantup.com/precise32.box. This document describes
   how you can create your own "basebox," using Ubuntu's Saucy
   Salamander (13.10) (64 bit) as an example.

   It presumes you have Virtual Box and Vagrant installed, as well as
   a good network connection to retrieve an ISO for Saucy Salamander
   and packages that will end up on the machine (chef, puppet, ruby,
   etc).

   I used Virtual Box 4.3.4 and Vagrant 1.3.5.
